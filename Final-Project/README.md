# Picasso

An application that allows the user to create expressions that
evaluate to colors and then eventually to images.

The given code base is a good start, but it is sparsely documented
(document each method/part after you understand what it's doing) and,
as your application grows, you may need to refactor.

See the specification for Picasso on the course web site

## Project Organization

`src` - the source code for the project

`conf` - the configuration files for the project

The `images` directory contains some sample images generated from Picasso.  Some of the expressions for these images can be found in the `expressions` directory.

##Extensions
View Assigned Button - Allows user to view collection of assigned expressions and their identifiers, along with a small pixmap of the given expression. Updates everytime new window is opened

View multiple images at once - This functionality allows the users to view evaluated expressions in a separate window when they click "view in new Window" button. They can view different expressions in as many windows as they want.

Randomly generate a new equation - Allows user to randomly generate a new expression by pressing button, expression is then displayed on screen
